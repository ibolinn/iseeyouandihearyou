    <p><font color="white">female</font>I’m not sure what <font color="white">identification monikers</font>are most common <font color="white">identification</font>I have among strangers is that a <font color="white">Chinese</font>person can I find myself in reaction that how others are interacting with me but if I were interacting only with myself that would be as a sign in as a <font color="white">father</font> is this <font color="white">identity visible hidden</font> or <font color="white">concealed</font> belt <font color="white">dad</font> in <font color="white">Chinese</font> is very evident and has been a cause of some discomfort lately because of the political situation but the other parts are invisible until I begin to speak how much do you think about this <font color="white">identity</font> probably next how I see myself if you could sum up how <font color="white">Society</font> views you in three words what would they be I think now it’s just saved my life Parkland <font color="white">visual</font> I think I’m not dude it’s very important but that’s not how I feel number one number to mail number three older what does <font color="white">privilege</font> mean to you <font color="white">choices</font> it means <font color="white">Solutions</font> I think about this search for me me benefit not do you consider yourself <font color="white">privileged</font> Elsa I’m <font color="white">privileged</font> that <font color="white">I’m in a good relationship</font> I’m <font color="white">privileged</font> that we are <font color="white">financially comfortable</font> I’m <font color="white">privileged</font> my life is <font color="white">not a struggle children are healthy don’t have things that hold me back</font> or things that I could help cuz I believe that <font color="white">benefits earned</font> our <font color="white">privileges</font> I don’t feel <font color="white">privileged</font> I sure gratified that that much I <font color="white">worked very hard</font> to achieve occurred but they don’t call them <font color="white">privileges</font> well you kind of already answered this in a way but can <font color="white">privileges</font> be ordered I didn’t see it that way when you ask question feelings that I express you are not <font color="white">earned</font> feeling I don’t see it that way David the different interpretation of can you think of a time when you really felt your <font color="white">privilege</font> and it’s okay if the answer is no I wouldn’t call it a <font color="white">privilege</font> but I would say that I had <font color="white">stereotypes</font> lied to me that were <font color="white">beneficial</font> in the context of how those three types were made for example The <font color="white">Stereotype</font> of a <font color="white">Chinese man</font> who wears glasses that speaks very good <font color="white">English</font> is presumed and other ways that are <font color="white">advantageous</font> to the particular situation I don’t call that a <font color="white">privilege</font> I call that the <font color="white">benefits</font> that derive from a <font color="white">stereotype</font> that I wouldn’t necessarily want to have can you think of a time when you felt disadvantaged are at a disadvantage a lot as a <font color="white">woman</font> where people don’t treat me the same as they would have been friends since recently when we had contractors in our house we were rather dismissive of me when I ask questions I thought that is a lot of social contact or you know my <font color="white">breast</font> so well reconsidering what you just described I believe that I have <font color="white">benefited</font> from <font color="white">privileges</font> of being a <font color="white">man</font> but not in the same way that a <font color="white">white man</font> would have <font color="white">benefited</font> an example I have <font color="white">benefits</font> that are attributed to me for being <font color="white">tall</font> which of course has nothing to do with anything except for the <font color="white">bias</font> in better than <font color="white">Western Society</font> the <font color="white">tall</font> was associated with <font color="white">intelligence advancements</font> so that would be a <font color="white">benefit not earned</font> but I see it more as a <font color="white">stereotype</font> being that HR <font color="white">Chinese</font> is so different that garnered attention relative to stealing the situation I have been verbally accosted assaulted I would say for being <font color="white">Chinese</font> because of the current political situation of the coronavirus which has been encouraged by the current Administration do you see a connection with it probably yes about how to explain it so I just finished resume class where we had new <font color="white">members</font> join because we just started the fall semester and the new <font color="white">members</font> are all <font color="white">older white men</font> the distinct feeling whether or not it was intended by these new <font color="white">white men members</font> was it they should be listened to expected to be listen to even though this is a Zumba class of 25 people enter such I think that <font color="white">privilege</font> as expressed as <font color="white">white privilege</font> particularly <font color="white">white man’s privilege</font> has innumerable expectations better signal overtly implicitly example resume class I just finished okay we just do you ever feel and I mean that in the sense that at these moments when you felt at a disadvantage or you see others at a disadvantage do you ever feel the need to ask or the call Hannah Kate weather launch a protest March probably something like that or two act in a way that I thought would help even afford subtle yeah you know where to start and what it is I know when we were on a smart or organizations is an act their shuttle is quiet but the kind of action okay these two more questions are one less that you want to add something well I think that’s certainly I believe I didn’t gauge than two types of actions when is a form of Jiu Jitsu where you leverage against that which is a current example bag contractors you come over to the house that ignore your <font color="white">mother</font> because she’s a <font color="white">woman</font> and therefore I will introduce myself as a <font color="white">man</font> in order to keep the thing moving rather than try to convince the person that actually Christine knows more about the problem that needs to be solved 90 that’s not confrontational that’s rather trying to lubricate the situation to get the problem solved that we need done it at that moment the more <font color="white">overt</font> method would be when I see either <font color="white">overt macro aggression</font> or persistent <font color="white">microaggression</font> and I will pull it out and called it out on this area soon classes where there is <font color="white">China</font> bashing going on and extended to those of <font color="white">Chinese</font> descent and I’ve seen it in other meetings of Corporations where there is evidence inclusive <font color="white">bias unconscious bias</font> and I will try to call it out as being against the <font color="white">values</font> that are supposed to be in the company so but you have to pick and choose those okay these last two questions are they can be yes or no or you can elaborate if you turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper you will see people who look like you widely and positively <font color="white">represented</font> yes for you I would say that you will see yourself in the newspapers or media marketing <font color="white">opportunities</font> so that regards it is one of being in the <font color="white">majority</font> that has a marketing <font color="white">opportunity</font> weather beic <font color="white">man</font> but those are not <font color="white">Chinese man</font> built or <font color="white">white man</font> example of what would justify the Hitman the final question is I can be pretty sure that if I get angry and ask to talk to the person in charge I will be facing a person who looks like me absolutely. Probably not my situation is almost always been being the only <font color="white">person of color</font> in the room where decisions are made read last night when I talked to Zoe about this about the newspaper thing she said that she would not see images of herself and I said I would see images of myself but she disagreed and said that she sees me everywhere and she said <font color="white">someone in their 30s</font> doing whatever they want <font color="white">traveling the world</font> and getting a new dog okay well when I don’t I don’t see myself because I don’t see people of <font color="white">mixed race</font> and when I do see a <font color="white">woman</font> of color that usually have long hair their <font color="white">tall</font> they’re <font color="white">skinny</font> they are very <font color="white">beautiful</font> they have long hair and their if they are a <font color="white">person of color</font> there usually a <font color="white">black person</font> and anytime I see an <font color="white">Asian woman</font> it’s better for the new Mulan trailer or she’s an engineer or she’s in Tech and so he said well you’re not <font color="white">Asian</font> and I was like okay well and I said that’s because people look at you and they say that you’re half <font color="white">white</font> and they look at me and they say hi I’m half <font color="white">asian</font> yeah yeah well neither one of you we don’t see a lot we don’t see a lot of <font color="white">Asians</font> in the mood and marijuana a lot of <font color="white">mixed races</font> future wife print media and and they often portray <font color="white">people of color</font> in a negative mode does Embassy in <font color="white">San Francisco</font> it’s a little different than the rest we have <font color="white">people of color</font> are FedEx unique to <font color="white">United States</font> you going to have to be more specific <font color="white">identify</font> in terms of <font color="white">race nationality sexual orientation gender</font> Siri when people ask you how you are doing what people are asking because my answer depends no comment if it's the government in general just say 3333 year old <font color="white">male</font> that's the <font color="white">visible identity</font>outside of the <font color="white">age</font> the one that I gave you I don't think much about it if there was any part of that <font color="white">identity</font> that <font color="white">identifier</font> thought about Mossad probably be the <font color="white">male</font> part is because <font color="white">Society</font> puts different pressures in The Simpsons on <font color="white">men</font> these questions are more about people to give an in-depth answer of how they would have done if I like <font color="white">race</font> and <font color="white">gender</font> and <font color="white">sexual orientation</font> obviously answers to be more elaborate but in my opinion if someone was asking me about those <font color="white">identity features</font> it's not there it's not their business nor it's something that I would share with anybody if you what parts of <font color="white">society</font> yeah so I can I give you two answers so answer number one is the kavya in the communities that I'm mostly interact with their predominantly middle to upper middle<font color="white">class</font> and predominately <font color="white">white</font> reason I emphasize the <font color="white">white</font> part is because that view I think is different than maybe General <font color="white">Society</font> or the the Roses <font color="white">society</font> that we all Aspire think it should be so I think generally they look at me as a <font color="white">young</font> probably <font color="white">younger</font> than I actually am mixer <font color="white">Asian male</font> I don't think they make any strong judgments on my <font color="white">socioeconomic factor</font> and I think the occasion was so sweet stair types with being <font color="white">Asian</font> go along with their assumptions that's from the <font color="white">society</font> that has generally <font color="white">white</font> and <font color="white">upper middle class</font> a city in New York where it's quite diverse I think they would just view me as a <font color="white">mixed</font> rather than <font color="white">Asian young man</font> are probably on The Middle <font color="white">socioeconomic</font> scale nothing more than average what does <font color="white">privilege</font> mean what does <font color="white">privileged</font> mean to me previous means access to <font color="white">opportunity</font>. Others don't have that are in and out of your <font color="white">control</font>. Which also means also means welt <font color="white">education</font> and <font color="white">privilege</font> to me that means choices thousand percent yes also I have a <font color="white">loving family</font> that's <font color="white">financially secure</font> all the <font color="white">opportunities</font> that fast forward to make it and Achieve and <font color="white">prosper</font> and not only this <font color="white">society</font> as a <font color="white">minority</font> but in general more than anyone else all things that's me alright so a thousand percent I'm going to say generally know I think when people ask him <font color="white">privileges</font> biyernes people might immediately say well you earned it by <font color="white">hard work</font> you are and if I'm making <font color="white">money</font> you are by studying real hard in <font color="white">school</font> in the fact is that I think in society and the <font color="white">structures</font> built around us you can do all those and you can put in the Blood Sweat and Tears but if the <font color="white">system</font> doesn't work for you it doesn't matter so can it be earned in general I don't think so I think there are moments here and there but during the wildfires being able to go to <font color="white">college</font> anytime on on a <font color="white">vacation vacation</font> itself anytime there's a <font color="white">job opportunity</font> I mean there's countless times everyday I feel <font color="white">privileged</font> that I have <font color="white">choices</font> didn't have a <font color="white">choice</font> to go to a <font color="white">job</font> that I have a <font color="white">choice</font> to spend <font color="white">money</font> that I have a <font color="white">choice</font> to <font color="white">travel</font> and visit my family every single one of those moments anytime someone describes me or views me by my exterior specifically me being <font color="white">mixed</font> or <font color="white">Asian</font> is when is automatically your being put in the box and assumed it out I'm in we always joke Isabel right that we didn't know that we are next until <font color="white">white people</font> so is the <font color="white">white hierarchy</font> easy connection between expectations I do I think it's less about exceeding expectations and I think it's more about Billy expectations I think that the idea that is if you have <font color="white">privilege</font> and let's say you can waste <font color="white">privilege</font> but then maybe you can always abused <font color="white">privileged</font> so for example if you're a <font color="white">upper middle-class</font> kids from Moran and you got into opioids with the opioid epidemic because you're over prescribed by a <font color="white">doctor</font> and as a result you became a drug addict then you didn't meet expectations but if you're in the same <font color="white">class</font> and you became the <font color="white">doctor</font> I don't think you exceeded expectations that make sense Define Act and that's any degree of Act is that correct yeah absolutely I do feel the need to act and I think that they do act at times because I am partly <font color="white">privileged</font> I have the <font color="white">flexibility</font> in the <font color="white">choice</font> to act many people don't in terms of what in the end end to what means Zoe talks about volunteering and mom talked about building so sure yeah I think I do I think the first part is being vocal the second part is I think it's also just your own behavior that's where usually I start myself and example being <font color="white">female</font> empowerment yeah I'm a gentleman asked me how what did I do how how did I earn in my response was I didn't do anything I acted as if I would treat anybody else than just the sheer active expecting that a <font color="white">young woman</font> on my team would have equal weight <font color="white">responsibilities</font> as a <font color="white">young man</font> in the same position was the behavior that when we leave work so I think that's it is a place where I generally start his <font color="white">men</font> Behavior I have a question in there they can be yes or no if you turn on the television or open the front page of the paper you will see people who look like you widely and positively I'm going to say yes and no to that I'm going to say no from the outside meaning other people don't view me as I view myself if I look at it then I do some people like me because I generally do myself as <font color="white">upper-middle class</font> mail person in charge of the person who looks like oh absolutely not because I'm and some part of <font color="white">young</font> but BM mixed absolutely no no you talking in person charge highly likely that it's going to be an <font color="white">old white man</font> okay Tell me a little bit about you my name is <font color="white">Mark</font> I live in <font color="white">Raleigh</font> I'm from <font color="white">New York</font> born in <font color="white">New York</font> move to <font color="white">San Francisco</font> for a number of years in <font color="white">Raleigh</font> for about the last year how do you <font color="white">identify</font> I <font color="white">identify</font> as <font color="white">Jewish</font> another question of life is that a <font color="white">race</font> or not and I don't think there's any hard answer but as far as what how do I <font color="white">identify</font> that's always been the first thing that I think of I mean my family all of my grandparents are <font color="white">first-generation Americans</font> all of their families were from Gold Rush show the old Soviet Union territories in all of my grandparents for <font color="white">first-generation Americans</font> I'm sorry that you know as far as cultural heritage to <font color="white">identify</font> when someone asks me that my first thought is is really just to say I'm <font color="white">Jewish</font> definitely all of them and it's it's a combination of a lot of things I mean you know 222 a large extent <font color="white">Judaism</font> is a <font color="white">religion</font> right it's not a <font color="white">race</font> but at the same time I've been told by people that I know I've been approached by strangers who say they saw my <font color="white">face</font> and they know that I'm <font color="white">Jewish</font> I've had friends say to me I saw someone on the street that looks just like you and I save for the sake bearded and vaguely <font color="white">Jewish</font> looking and every time so I do think that something bad that's visually <font color="white">identifiable</font> to some people but not to not to everyone some people might just see me as a generic <font color="white">white male</font> boxing I would say nearly daily I had a conversation with a friend years ago who once said to me that you know just about every day of your life something will happen conversation will happen almost at every day of your life you will be reminded of the fact that you're <font color="white">Jewish</font> not necessarily negative sometimes positive your I am someone who <font color="white">identifies</font> as part of this group that is a <font color="white">major minority</font> and I'm not necessarily A deeply <font color="white">religious</font> person and it's not it's not about that for me it's just about it's a part of my call through it's a part of my <font color="white">Heritage</font> it's a part of my family it's a part of who I am regardless of what I say or what I believe I am <font color="white">Jewish</font> because I was born <font color="white">Jewish</font> but it's me a lot when I was living in <font color="white">San Francisco</font>. I never really did it and I always felt guilty and now living in <font color="white">North Carolina</font> which I consider to be very much <font color="white">the South</font> it feels weird in that sense I mean I don't think anyone's down there looks at me and passing those oh that that's a <font color="white">Jewish guy</font> but I feel like a Target and not that I've had <font color="white">experiences</font> down there but I guess I feel more out of place even though maybe I look less so out of place because there are less people that would see me and see my <font color="white">facial features</font> and recognize that you know I'm I'm I'm <font color="white">Jewish</font> I kind of feel a bit more sometimes and other people but that's a whole other can of worms how to save YouTube videos <font color="white">white male Jewish privilege</font> to me means <font color="white">not have to worry about things that other people have to worry about</font> that I've been <font color="white">privileged</font> comes in many different forms but ultimately to me it just means there are difficulties that you don't you're not going to have to face that other people have to face were things will be easier for you and you're part of a kind of a <font color="white">select group</font> of smaller group just by the nature of issues that you don't have to deal with that so many other people do have to deal with and a lot of times that <font color="white">privilege</font> comes with you know things that you don't you don't think about that you don't approve of things that you <font color="white">take for granted</font> that a lot of other people don't have the luxury of taking it for granted consider yourself pregnant no not overall I mean I realize that I am a <font color="white">white heterosexual male</font> and by that definition alone I am in the top <font color="white">class</font> of of <font color="white">privilege</font> and then I'm not allowed to complain about anything just buy those things alone in the world but in from my <font color="white">experience</font> you had a <font color="white">middle-class upbringing</font> and you know I don't feel as though I've had I guess for my point is I don't it's not apparent to me I don't feel as though I've had a <font color="white">leg up in the world</font> even though introspectively I feel like I'm supposed to recognize that by the <font color="white">color of my skin</font> by my <font color="white">gender</font> and things like that that I am <font color="white">privileged</font> yes <font color="white">privileges</font> can be earned I think personally when I think of <font color="white">privilege</font> as a broader concept I'm usually initially drawn to the things that are a bit more 1/8 or a bit more you know just part of someone's life and part of some <font color="white">experience</font> from <font color="white">birth</font> what can provide be earned absolutely you know people can really the one main thing that comes to mind with learning <font color="white">privilege</font> is is <font color="white">financial finance Financial power financial status</font> you know whether it's acquiring <font color="white">money</font> through work acquiring when I think of acquiring <font color="white">privilege</font> or sorry earning earning <font color="white">privilege</font> I guess my mind Ross to <font color="white">finance</font> first and foremost which kind of puts someone in a <font color="white">different category</font> than most of the world one thing that comes to mind last year my fiance and I will have to be the interviewee we leave we left our <font color="white">jobs</font> in our <font color="white">homes</font> and we packed up to <font color="white">travel abroad</font> he told her friends and family and people that we knew and ran into we're <font color="white">traveling abroad</font> we're going to <font color="white">travel</font> the world for 6 months and even just saying that allowed felt very imposter syndrome and it felt very like people could only do that if they have a lot of <font color="white">money</font> if they have the <font color="white">financial ability</font> to to do that and I honestly even fell just talking about it with other people at Felts <font color="white">gloating</font> I don't know it is felt like even just a conversation bringing up the conversation just mentioning it to me felt like there was <font color="white">financial status</font> attached to it even though I didn't look at that as the reality of my situation I felt like speaking about it was like waving it in someone's face <font color="white">Financial</font> kind of way I guess that was the one saying where that I can think of right now where it felt <font color="white">privileged</font> just try to think of it as if I had heard someone else say to me I am doing this we're leaving our jobs are packing up our things I'm going to try you have the <font color="white">money</font> for that leave your <font color="white">job</font> and <font color="white">travel</font> like you must be in a comfortable situation so I guess because my mind first goes to the <font color="white">finance</font> side of it I assumed but that's where other people take it so that made me uncomfortable talking about it when I was excited and nervous at the same time you know about this fun thing that my fiance Network we're planning to do maybe that's that's more I guess everything that I just said kind of <font color="white">identifies</font> more with guilt but how kilts was attached to my sense of reflection of <font color="white">privilege</font> what time did I stop yeah time that I felt disadvantage the one thing that comes to mind is when I first left <font color="white">New York</font> and then drove out to <font color="white">San Francisco</font> and started a new life in <font color="white">San Francisco</font> and it took a little bit for me to get a <font color="white">job</font> and then I did and I wasn't making that much <font color="white">money</font> I was skating by but some friends that I had out there were more local and they definitely came from comfortable memes and their friends that they hung out with came from very very comfortable <font color="white">affluent advantageous situations</font> and just hanging out with them on the weekends I just felt like the conversations they were having and just knowing where they came from and basically just knowing that you know they imposter syndrome is the best way to put it I felt like I didn't even belong having a conversation with these people because I knew that they were going to forever be <font color="white">millionaires</font> in here I was with you know mediocre job kind of making ends meet so like me going out on the weekend hanging out with her friends was like my big thing for them that was like a quiet quiet time where they you know maybe where I'm spending as much <font color="white">money</font> as they would of the Chimes connection between expectations and <font color="white">privilege</font> all right now I feel compelled to act yes there are times when you know certainly things that were going on spring and summer things pertaining to social. I'm just being forced to sit at home and go through your screen and looking at the news I'm looking at what was going on in the world outside and it definitely made me feel <font color="white">guilty</font> in a sense of how could I not be doing something how can I not be out there marching with people because if I'm not marching with people does that mean that I don't you know that I'm not on the right side so as far as being pushed feeling compelled to act yes but I guess so much what I was saying previously I think it kind of comes from feelings of guilt almost do I know where to start I don't think there is any one specific I think there's the answer is there is no answer any little thing or any big thing that you do is good but it also is not enough so you need to continually work whether it's <font color="white">educated</font> yourself whether it's somehow taking action that specifically affects another person honestly I think the answer is anything big or small is helpful is the right thing to do but is also not enough because you can always continue what you do more if you turn on the television or open if you if you turn on the television if you are. I would say no to things the first one just cuz I was speaking about it earlier as far as my <font color="white">Jewish identity</font> certainly don't think <font color="white">Jewish</font> people are looked at in a positive light in <font color="white">American Media</font> today there either becoming scapegoats or by being victims of <font color="white">anti-Semitism</font> that sometimes seems to be the only depiction and the only narrative and it and it just makes me uncomfortable when that's the only thing that you see on the flip side just as being a <font color="white">white male</font> I feel like I constantly need to apologize for the awful things that <font color="white">white males</font> are are doing it and then I was being represented in the <font color="white">media</font>it just seems like the bad guy the villain is always a <font color="white">white male</font> and it makes me cringe because never called this is how I identify myself you know how early I know that that's how I'm presented to people so I guess it's something that I feel any to my almost need to apologize for sometimes how old is Jason I would say no because if I think about it it it probably would I feel like the answer. I'm supposed to say is that it would be a <font color="white">white male</font> but I just don't think they would look like me or I would look at them and I would just think different again because I think of the <font color="white">typical white male</font> it is the term <font color="white">wasp</font> I guess I guess part of it is that I feel different from how I think I am portrayed and how I come across so when I see people that my first thought is you're not you're not <font color="white">Jewish</font> there are <font color="white">white male</font> separate from me I guess what I want to say is I answer is because I feel a comfortability I don't feel a level of familiarity I feel in other nests so while to someone else you might have here is two <font color="white">white males</font> having a conversation I don't feel sameness I feel other nests but there was an apple you got it you got it like you got it you got to chop me up Whatever is your answer is your answer so don't worry if there's no lie quiz or test or anything one of those <font color="white">66 years old</font> I have a <font color="white">part-time job</font> and I'm very involved in being safe during covid-19 children and I just became a <font color="white">grandmother</font> baby <font color="white">girl</font> went to boys and that I have a <font color="white">daughter-in-law</font> and a future

color="white">granddaughter</font> or tell us what what's going on I mean as far as being I'm I <font color="white">identify</font> as being <font color="white">female</font> and Y and <font color="white">Jewish</font> and married and I <font color="white">identify</font> as <font color="white">male </font>Island very <font color="white">Suburban neighborhood</font> and <font color="white">white</font> and <font color="white">Jewish</font> have two wonderful kids terrific <font color="white">granddaughter</font> have a great is this <font color="white">identity physical hidden</font> or <font color="white">concealed</font> herbal absolutely visible Isabel how much do you think oh very often like daily if you could sum up how <font color="white">Society</font> views you in three words what would they be <font color="white">senior citizen New Yorker White</font> now say happy laughing and friendly what does <font color="white">privilege</font> mean to you <font color="white">privilege</font> means to me having the <font color="white">financial ability</font> to have the <font color="white">best of everything</font> the <font color="white">best education</font> the <font color="white">best clothes best home</font> the <font color="white">best car everything materialistic</font> I agree with that <font color="white">privilege</font> is so many good things in life you consider yourself <font color="white">privileged</font> in respect to enjoying our lives and round let me think so I consider myself <font color="white">privileged</font> I'm going to say no because there are things that I can't afford that I would like to have I mean <font color="white">I have everything that I want</font> but it was like a <font color="white">dream list of things</font> I would have to say that now I'm sticking with what I said I will sure like a children can learn from which has <font color="white">the rules</font> can you think of a time when you felt when you really felt your <font color="white">privilege</font> it's okay if the answer is no well I could think of times when I felt more better off than somebody else because the things that I've had it done you want a specific answer sure if you have one like if I tell somebody we got a <font color="white">brand new car</font> and then I seen that makes me feel like I'm <font color="white">lucky</font> or you don't feel better than no I don't feel better than anybody else if I have more than somebody else and something that I would feel more can you think of a time when you felt disadvantage or at a disadvantage and you can interpret that as you up I'm sure there was I would say it two times in my life when I worked at certain places and I work with people word good people and I felt disadvantage I can't ask her there is but I can't come up with a good example I don't think so no can you say why just cuz you expect something you expect it doesn't necessarily happen maybe you weren't something and it came at you you might do you ever feel compelled to act when I say that when you were at a disadvantage or you saw someone at a disadvantage or whatever the situation if you ever feel compelled to say <font color="white">white</font> why you treating that person like that who you okay and that's not at all what I thought you were resting what do you think what you think I asked so I thought you were acting like is there a time when I felt I didn't have something and I saw somebody else have it and what did I do to get that for myself as well example my friend has a beautiful dress and I didn't you know somebody was I going to do to be able to go get that sing beautiful dress <font color="white">work harder saved my money</font> though you don't go to the same store and get the same thing do you know where to start so if you did want to ask we felt like you should ask you know where to start Google if I answer on what I said yeah I would they can be yes or no or you can elaborate it's up to you if you turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and you will see people who look like you widely is positively <font color="white">represented</font> what's the last part of that again at times yes yes and Wyatt time I might I might turn on the TV and see somebody that you might have the same kind of <font color="white">Lifestyles</font> I do with same situation I'm in my life situation and it look like a happy person and I say okay you know what I could see that and then sometimes I turn it on and I'll see somebody who's who's very unhappy who's treated unfairly and I get very upset about that so it's not like me and as far as opening up reading a newspaper on the front page bad news that song in the news so in that respect if that's the case then I would say that's not like me that persons not like me and then the last question I can be pretty sure that if I got angry and asked to talk to the person in charge I will be facing a person who looks like me I have no comment on that agree or disagree and now I never thought about that not necessarily so no never gave that any thought so if you went if you went to a department store and you had to return something and the person who spoke you is rude and you wanted to speak to your manager would that manager look like you I would give it any thought hassles like you do they expect okay well
